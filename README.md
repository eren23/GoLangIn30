# GoLangIn30

Since I find GoLang fun and useful, this repo is me trying to take what I can from the GoLang in 30 days starting from the absolute "0".

The goal is to be able to create little _fun_ a project(s) by the the end of the month, it won't be an intensive only GoLang month for me.

Each day will own its own folder, I hope not to skip any of the days.

_Each example is in its own directory because reusing the main warning was annoying._
