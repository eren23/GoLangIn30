package main
//Use os.Exit to immediately exit with a given status.
import (

func main() {

    defer fmt.Println("!") //defers will not be run when using os.Exit, so this fmt.Println will never be called.

    os.Exit(3) //Exit with status 3.
}
//Note that unlike e.g. C, Go does not use an integer return value from main to indicate exit status. If youâ€™d like to exit with a non-zero status you should use os.Exit.
